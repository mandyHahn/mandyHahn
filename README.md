## Hey everyone! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Amanda Hahn, a new grad University of Guelph with a Bachelors in Honours Computer Science and a minor in Psychology. Here you'll find my personal projects, school work that I'm exceptionally proud of, and work from hackathons. I plan on starting more personal projects in the near future, so keep an eye out on my profile for more additions!
