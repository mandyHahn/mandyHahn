## Hey everyone! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Amanda Hahn, a fifth-year Honours Computer Science (co-op) student at the University of Guelph. Here you'll mostly find my personal projects and work from hackathons. I also plan on starting more personal projects in the near future, so keep an eye out on my profile for more additions!
